# Motivator

An application to send challenges to people. You can ask someone to, for example, run from Amsterdam Central Station to the Amsterdam RAI. As a proof you can ask them to send a picture from the start and the finish. And it is possible to describe beforehand a reward of course!

Perhaps, you would like to sport so now and then, but you don't get the motivation up and running. This application can make you do that first step!

## Dataset

This application is not just for fun. You can really help other people as well. The data collected, which will be totally private to the project partners at [Sensei](http://www.commit-nl.nl/projects/sensei-sensor-based-engagement-for-improved-health), will be used to create a perfect virtual coach which learns from challenges people give each other. This project is an academic project and is not meant for commercial gain. Hence, the open-source character of this application.
